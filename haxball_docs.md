HaxBall Headless Host
The headless room host is useful if you want to run an unmanned haxball host on a vps. It doesn't draw or play any sounds which makes it a lot more lightweight. It is only controllable through a javascript API.

You can load the headless host here

Connectivity warning
If you are hosting on a VPS using Chrome version 78 or greater it is required to disable the Local IP WebRTC Anonymization feature for the host to work.

Run chrome with the command flag --disable-features=WebRtcHideLocalIpsWithMdns to disable the feature.

API
When haxball headless host is done loading it will set window.HBInit and call the function window.onHBLoaded

Note: All of the API functions that modify the game's state will execute asynchronously. This means that if you move a player using the roomObject.setPlayerTeam method and immediately after you call roomObject.getPlayerList, the player list obtained will show the player's original team and not the modified one.

HBInit(roomConfig : RoomConfigObject) : RoomObject
Use this function to initialize the room, it returns the room object used to control the room.

After calling this function a recaptcha challenge will appear, after passing the recaptcha the room link will appear on the page.

Example:

var room = HBInit({
	roomName: "My room",
	maxPlayers: 16,
	noPlayer: true // Remove host player (recommended!)
});
room.setDefaultStadium("Big");
room.setScoreLimit(5);
room.setTimeLimit(0);

// If there are no admins left in the room give admin to one of the remaining players.
function updateAdmins() { 
  // Get all players
  var players = room.getPlayerList();
  if ( players.length == 0 ) return; // No players left, do nothing.
  if ( players.find((player) => player.admin) != null ) return; // There's an admin left so do nothing.
  room.setPlayerAdmin(players[0].id, true); // Give admin to the first non admin player in the list
}

room.onPlayerJoin = function(player) {
  updateAdmins();
}

room.onPlayerLeave = function(player) {
  updateAdmins();
}
RoomConfigObject
RoomConfig is passed to HBInit to configure the room, all values are optional.

roomName : string
The name for the room.

playerName : string
The name for the host player.

password : string
The password for the room (no password if ommited).

maxPlayers : int
Max number of players the room accepts.

public : bool
If true the room will appear in the room list.

geo : {"code": string, "lat" : float, "lon" : float}
GeoLocation override for the room.

token : String
Can be used to skip the recaptcha by setting it to a token that can be obtained here

These tokens will expire after a few minutes.

noPlayer : Bool
If set to true the room player list will be empty, the playerName setting will be ignored.

Default value is false for backwards compatibility reasons but it's recommended to set this to true.

Warning! events will have null as the byPlayer argument when the event is caused by the host, so make sure to check for null values!

Sets the room's kick rate limits.

min is the minimum number of logic-frames between two kicks. It is impossible to kick faster than this.

rate works like min but lets players save up extra kicks to use them later depending on the value of burst.

burst determines how many extra kicks the player is able to save up.

setPlayerAvatar

// Add "wall" to the collision mask of disc 5 without changing any other of it's flags:
var discProps = room.getDiscProperties(5);
room.setDiscProperties(5, {cMask: discProps.cMask | room.CollisionFlags.wall});

auth : String | null
The player's public ID. Players can view their own ID's here: https://www.haxball.com/playerauth

The public ID is useful to validate that a player is who he claims to be, but can't be used to verify that a player isn't someone else. Which means it's useful for implementing user accounts, but not useful for implementing a banning system.

Can be null if the ID validation fails.

This property is only set in the RoomObject.onPlayerJoin event.

cMask : Int
The disc's collision mask (Represents what groups the disc can collide with)

cGroup : Int
The disc's collision groups

CollisionFlagsObject
CollisionFlagsObjects contains flag constants that are used as helpers for reading and writing collision flags.

The flags are ball, red, blue, redKO, blueKO, wall, all, kick, score, c0, c1, c2 and c3

Example usage:

var cf = room.CollisionFlags;

// Check if disc 4 belongs to collision group "ball":
var discProps = room.getDiscProperties(4);
var hasBallFlag = (discProps.cGroup & cf.ball) != 0;

var discProps = room.getDiscProperties(5);
room.setDiscProperties(5, {cMask: discProps.cMask | cf.wall});
